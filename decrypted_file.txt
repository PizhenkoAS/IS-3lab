Stanford University in California has launched its first class taught fully with virtual reality, or VR, technology.

Virtual reality involves the creation of digital environments that can be entered and controlled by humans. People use a headset that permits them to see virtual settings and objects, along with electronic controllers, to experience VR environments.

The new class, or course, is called “Virtual People.” It is taught by Jeremy Bailenson, a professor of communication.

Bailenson came up with the idea after teaching students about VR for nearly 20 years. During that time, he saw the technology continue to develop and decided the best way to demonstrate its abilities was to create a full course experience with VR.

The class covers the expanding influence of VR in many different fields, “including popular culture, engineering, behavioral science and communication,” the official course description reads.
